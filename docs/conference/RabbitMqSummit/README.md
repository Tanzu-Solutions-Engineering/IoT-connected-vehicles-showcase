## Overview


The session will illustrate how to build scalable and resilient IoT messaging solutions. This session will include a demonstration of microservice-based applications that utilize RabbitMQ for Reliable messaging and High throughput.

The talk will focus on developing software applications that can run on any device that needs to share information over the Internet. 

The talk will walk through an example of running embedded software in cars, planes, and other vehicles.

It will explain the challenges with aggregating information from these devices. It will detail the typical deployment options to 
connect with devices. RabbitMQ will be used by the devices to publishing messages from the edge vehicle environment to a central hub 
where Internet connective may be limited and unreliable.


## Demo
The material will be based on a working example of a  solution.
There will apps to simulate vehicle-generated details such as GPS location, speed, and other vehicle statistics. 
There will be a visualization of the aggregated vehicle info in a central hub. I will demonstrate how RabbitMQ supports resiliency 
to deal with networking issues. I will also demonstrate the IoT friend networking protocols such as MQTT. I will also be demonstrated the new 
RabbitMQ streaming protocol to support replay messages as needed. The deployment environment will be based on Kubernetes.
